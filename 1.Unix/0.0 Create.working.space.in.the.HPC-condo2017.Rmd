## Use the storage space in /freetmp/cktuggle-free
Large temporary space /freetmp is mounted on free nodes and on condodtn (it's not mounted on condo login node). Users should use /freetmp/cktuggle-free. To access that space and use it as working space. Please follow the instruction belows after logging in the head node (login node):

```bash
# you should be at your home directory
pwd 

# replace <your ISU NetID> with your real NetID
mkdir -p /freetmp/cktuggle-free/<your ISU NetID>_work   

# Create a symbolic link to your workspace
ln -s /freetmp/cktuggle-free/<your ISU NetID>_work   ./

# now you can start real work in this directory
cd   <your ISU NetID>_work   
```


## Materials for the UNIX session
The Materials for the UNIX session (except the PPTX files) are located in the condo2017 HPC. You can get a copy of them to your working space as follows:  

```bash
mkdir UNIX_tutorial
cd UNIX_tutorial

cp /home/haibol/cktuggle-free/Bioinformatics.workshop/UNIX/*   ./

```
